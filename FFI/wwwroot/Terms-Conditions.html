        <h5 style="text-align: center;font-size: 18px;">Data Privacy Undertaking to FPO Farmer members</h5>
        <p class="mt-3">While information is the cornerstone of our ability to provide superior service, our most important asset is FPO 
        farmer member’s trust. Keeping farmer member information secure and using it only as the FPO farmer members 
        would want us to is a top priority for all of us at Name </p>
        <p>Here then is our promise to our individual farmer members:</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>We will safeguard according to strict standards of security and confidentiality, any information FPO 
            farmer members share with us.</li>
            <li>We will limit the collection and use of farmer member information to the minimum we require to deliver 
            superior service to FPO farmer members. </li>
            <li>We will permit only authorized employees who are trained in the proper handling of farmer member 
            information to have access to that information. Employees who violate our Privacy Undertaking will be 
            subject to our disciplinary process.</li>
            <li>We will not reveal farmer member information to any external organization unless have been authorized 
            by the farmer members to do so or are required by law, Government or our regulators.</li>
            <li>We will always maintain control over the confidentiality of FPO farmer member information. We may 
            however facilitate relevant offers from reputable companies. These companies are not permitted to 
            retain any farmer member information unless the farmer member specifically expressed interest in 
            their products or services.</li>
            <li>Whenever we hire other organizations to provide support services, we will require them to conform to 
            our privacy standards and to allow us to audit them for compliance.</li>
            <li>We will not use or share internally or externally personally identifiable information for any purpose other 
            than that which the specific project requires and to which the farmer member consents.</li>
            <li>We will attempt to keep farmer member files complete, up to date and accurate. We will tell FPOs how 
            and where to conveniently access their Farmer member’s account information (except when we are 
            prohibited by law) and how to notify us about errors which we will promptly correct.</li>
            </ol>

            <p style="text-align:center">I have read and understood the Privacy Undertaking to FPO farmer members.</p>
            <p style="text-align:center">I understand my role in safeguarding farmer member privacy</p>
